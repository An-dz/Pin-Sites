StrappedPin
============

What's the problem?
-------------------

If you pin a tab, you normally do that to keep a certain website open at all times, right?
So there are two ways you're currently working:

1. You're the controlled type: You always open links in new tabs (via context menu or key modifiers) or
2. You always find yourself having clicked a link and now have to go back to your original website
(Most probably you're a mixture of both of them ;) )

What does this extension do?
----------------------------

StrappedPin will make your life easy.
Once it's installed, it will simply open all links in a new tab that leave the domain that you pinned! :+1:
And it's pretty smart. If you navigate back to your pinned content, it's automatically going to switch you back to your pinned tab.
That's handy if you are e.g. thrown to an external login page and get redirected back to wherever you were thereafter.
