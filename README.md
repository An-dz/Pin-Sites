StrappedPin
============

What's the problem?
-------------------

If you pin a tab, you normally do that to keep a certain website open at all times, right?
So there are two ways you're currently working:
1. You're the controlled type: You always open links in new tabs (via context menu or key modifiers) or
2. You always find yourself having clicked a link and now have to go back to your original website
(Most probably you're a mixture of both of them ;) )

What does this extension do?
----------------------------

StrappedPin (name may still change before release) will fix this for you.
Once it's installed, it will simply open all links in a new tab that leave the domain that you pinned! :+1:

Planned improvements
--------------------

Adding a page action that allows you to adjust when links should get opened in new tabs
